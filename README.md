This program simulates a travel in London using the Underground and other trains.
It needs a number for entry, a confirmation about your travel and a number for exit.
That will give to you the price of the travel based in wich zones you used and if you're or not at peak time.
The numbers of stations can be find in the "StationClass" class.
